#+title: Breaking The Habit Of Being Yourself
* Introduction The greatest habit you can ever break is the habit of being yourself
- Change as a choice, instead of a reaction
- The observer effect in quantum physics states that where you direct your attention is where you place your energy
- When how you appear is who you really are, you are truly free
* Part 1: The science of you
** Chapter 1: The quantum you
- Your thoughts have consequences so great that they create your reality
- Energy is the very fabric of all things material and is responsive to mind
- Mind and matter are completely entangled
- Only when subjects held both heightened emotions and clear objectives in alignment were they able to produce the intended effect
- The quantum field responds not to what we want; it responds to who we are being
- The new model of reality challenges us, to change something within us - in mind and body, in our thoughts and feelings - before we can experience the physical evidence with our senses
- Since the quantum field is nothing but immaterial probability, it is outside of space and time

** Chapter 2: Overcoming your environment
- To create something different from what you' ve grown accustomed to in your personal world, you have to change the way you routinely think and feel each day
- We can make our thoughts so real that the brain changes to look like the event has already become a physical reality
- Our thoughts can become our experience
** Chapter 3: Overcoming your body
- Every time you have a thought, there is a biochemical reaction in the brain
- Neuropeptides and hormones are the chemicals responsible for our feelings
- We first begin to feel the way we think and then we think the way we feel
- Thoughts are primarily related to the mind, feelings are connected to the bodyt
- To change is to think greater than how we feel
- When the body is the mind, that's called a habit
- To change your personality, you need to change your state of being
- By definition, emotions are the end products of past experiences
- Our genes are as changeable as our brains
** Chapter 4: Overcoming time
- Breaking the habit of being yourself is thinking and feeling equal to your body and time. Then learning to think and feel greater thant the big three
** Chapter 5: Survival vs Creation
- Every time we knock the body out of chemical balance, that's called stress
- Unlike animals we can turn on the fight or flight response by thought alone
- Living in creation is living as a nobody
* Part 2: Your brain and meditation
** Chapter 6: Three brains: Thinking to doing to being
- Knowledge is for the mind, experience is for the body
- Meditation allows us to change our brains, bodies and state of beings
- A new state of being creates a new personality, a new personality produces a new personal reality
- The combination of your thoughts and feelings is your state of being
- Thoughts and feelings must be coherent
** Chapter 7: The gap
- We have to become happy before our abundance shows up
- True happiness has nothing to do with pleasure
- A memory without the emotional charge is called wisdom
- One of the key skills you need to develop is self-awareness/ self observation
** Chapter 8: Meditation, demystifying the mystical and waves of your future
- As you go from being unaware to being aware, you are beginning to objectify your subjective mind
- Remind yourself who you no longer want to "be" until this becomes so familiar that you know your old self
- Then you repeatedly contemplate who you do want to "be"
- You have to break the habit of being yourself and reinvent a new self; lose your mind and create a new one; prune synaptic connections and nurture new ones; unmemorized past emotions and recondition the body to a new mind and emotions; and let go of the past and create a new future
- If you are constantly analyzing, you are in beta
- You can train yourself to move up and down the scale of brain waves
- When you go to seep you move through the spectrum of brain waves
- Remember that knowledge is the forerunner to experience
