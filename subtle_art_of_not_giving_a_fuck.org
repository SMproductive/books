#+title: Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck

* Don't try
- Self improvement often occur together but they are different things
- A happy person is just happy, affirmations are unneeded
- The key to a good life is to give a fuck about *less* i.e. care about less
** Feelings are feedback
 - We get feelings about feelings, if we stop caring about feelings we break the cycle
** Positive/Negative paradox
- The *desire* for more *positive* experience is a *negative* experience
- The *acceptance* of *negative* experience is a *positive* experience
- *The pain you pursue generates the positive*
  - The pain in the gym creates your best looking body
- *Stop* caring about the pain
  1. Stop caring means being comfortable with the fact that we care
     - Life hurts but we can decide with which pain we want to deal with
  2. *Decide* what you care for!
  3. We always *choose* what we care for
* Happiness is a problem
- Life itself is a form of *suffering*
- Happiness is an unsolvable equation
- Suffering is biologically useful
- The emotional pain of rejection or failure *teaches* us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future
- Happiness comes from *solving* problems
- Negative emotions are a call to action
- Positive emotions are rewards for taking proper action
- Emotions are just *suggestions*
* You are not special
- Amazing people become amazing because they are obsessed with improvement and that obsession stems from an unerring believe that they are below good enough
- The vast majority of our life will be *boring* and that's ok
* The value of suffering
- Self awareness:
  1. Understand your emotions
  2. Ask why you feel that emotion
  3. Be clear about your values
- Perceptions and feelings may change the underlying *values* *stay* the same
- By what standard do we measure ourselves?
- If you want to change how you see your problems you have to change what you value
- When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times we deny the existence of our life's problems
- Self improvement is about prioritizing better values
* You are always choosing
- We always control how we interpret what happens to us and how we respond
* You are wrong about everything (but so am I)
- Certainty is the enemy of growth
- All believes are wrong but some are less wrong
- *Uncertainty* removes our judgment of others
- *Uncertainty* is the root of all progress and all growth
- The more we *admit* we have to learn, the more opportunities we gain to learn
- The more something threatens to change us the more we will avoid doing it
* Failure is the way forward
- Better values are process oriented
- Growth generates happiness
- To change emotional state do something
* The importance of saying no
- To value 'x' we must reject 'y'
- Acts of love are only valid if they are performed without conditions or expectations
- Conflict is absolutely *necessary* to maintain healthy relationships
* ...and then you die
- A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time
- Happiness comes from caring about something greater than yourself
