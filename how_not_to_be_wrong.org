#+title: How not to be wrong the power of mathematical thinking
* Linearity
** When am I going to use this
- A mathematician is always asking, "What assumptions are you making? And are they justified"
- Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means
** Less like Sweden
- Nonlinear thinking means which way you should go depends on where you already are
** Straight locally, curved globally
- If you get a hard problem, try to solve a simpler one and hope the simple version is close enough
* Inference
** The detective, not the judge
- The purpose of statistics is to tell us what to do
** Radio psychics and the rule of Bayes
- We tend to like simpler theories better than more complicated ones
* Expectations
** What to expect when you're expecting to win the lottery
- Lotteries are a tax on the stupid
* Regression
** The triumph of mediocrity
- Regression to the mean
** The adventure of Karl Baeron across the tenth dimension
- Correlation is more like blood relation, it is intransitive
* Existence
** That does not compute
- When you are working hard on a theorem try to prove it by day and disprove it by night
- That's a good habit to put pressure on your beliefs
